This project is a capstone project from Coursera Specialization Robotics Course. The aim of this project is design a python code for control a robot arm to get and move a cube.

## Motivation

My first point to enroll in this Specialization is to get more confidence in robot control and design. This project mixed everything that I learned in this course and it became very interesting and challenge.

## Buid Status

The project has 90 percent of code done and after I will prepare a report with results and analysis.

## Python version

- Python 3.7
- modern_robotics python library
